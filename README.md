% ANOVAMOP: An interactive/non-interactive surrogate-based method for solving 
% high-dimensional computationally expensive %multiobjective optimization 
% problems of the form 
%         min {f_1(x),…f_k(x)}    subject to   LB <= x <= UB
% where 
% f_i, i=1,..k, are computationally expensive objective function 
% whose closed-form formulas are not available (i.e., black-box functions). 
%
% LB and UB are the lower and upper bounds of the decision variables. 
% ANOVAMOP aims at decomposing a high-dimensional problem into a finite number of 
% low-dimensional subproblems. Each subproblem is solved seperately. Solutions of 
% the subproblems are composed to form solutions for the original problem.

% To build surrogate function, in ANOVAMOP, the method developed in 
% 
% "M. Tan. Sequential Bayesian polynomial chaos model selection for estimation of
% sensitivity indices. SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty Quantification, 3:146–168,
% 2015." is applied. Feel free to replace this method with any another method. 
% 
% To apply ANOVAMOP as an interactive method, set "DM=1". In this case, the user 
% provides his/her preferences in a form of a reference point. In this case, 
% the final solutions in the decision and objective spaces are saved in 
% FinalSolutionDecisionSpace and FinalSolutionObjectiveSpace, respectively.
% 
% By setting "DM=0", ANOVAMOP is applied as a non-interactive. In this case, a set of
% solutions is provided at the end. The Solutions in the decision and objective spaces of subproblems 
% are saved in SubProblemsDecisionSpacePareto.mat SubProblemsObjectiveSpacePareto.mat, respectively. 
% The composed solutions in the decision and objective spaces for the original problem are saved in 
% DecisionSpaceParetoAll and ObjectiveSpaceParetoAll, respectively.
